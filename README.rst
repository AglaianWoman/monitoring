Watchdog - Server monitoring and data-collection daemon
==========================================================

Watchdog has been renamed to "Monitoring" as there was already a project
with the same name on PyPI.

You can checkout Monitoring's github repository here

    http://github.com/sebastien/monitoring

Or install it from PyPI

    easy_install monitoring

The `presentation on Watchdog <http://ur1.ca/45ku5>`_  is still valid for
Monitoring, except that the module is nom `monitoring`.
